I am honored to be a Ph.D. student in the department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). under the supervision of Professor Katie Bouman. My research interests include computational imaging, optimization, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in all kinds of imaging modalities and excited about innovations both in traditional imaging systems and with other related fields.

Prior to coming to Caltech, I was an undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis. I worked in the Computational Imaging Group and was fortunately advised by Professor Ulugbek S. Kamilov and Yu Sun, who helped me a lot with my research.
