I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of <a href="https://cms.caltech.edu/">Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS)</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Professor Katie Bouman</a>. My research interests include computational imaging, optimization, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in all kinds of imaging modalities and excited about innovations both in traditional imaging systems and with other related fields.

Prior to coming to Caltech, I was an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I was a member of the <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Computational Imaging Group</a> and fortunate to work with <a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Professor Ulugbek S. Kamilov</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5c52t54AAAAJ&hl=en">Yu Sun</a>, who helped me a lot with my research.
