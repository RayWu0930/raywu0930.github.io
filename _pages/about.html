I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), under the supervision of Professor Katie Bouman. My research interests include computational imaging, optimization, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in all kinds of imaging modalities and excited about innovations both in traditional imaging systems and with other related fields.

Prior to coming to Caltech, I was an undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis. I was a member of the Computational Imaging Group and fortunate to work with Professor Ulugbek S. Kamilov and Yu Sun, who helped me a lot with my research.

  I am going to start my PhD at Caltech and so I create this webpage to record my research history!
